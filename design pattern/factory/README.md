# Factory

- It is a creational design pattern, i.e., related to object creation. 
- We create objects without exposing the creation logic to the client and the client uses the same common interface to create a new type of object
- good for seperating the creation from use
- they allow you to group objects that belong together
- Example:
  - web shop where you have settings per country like currency, language, tax rates, shipping rates
